**CHATBOT**
Python (mini-project)
This Python conversational agent is a basic rule-based chatbot. It reacts to inputs from the user by using pre-established response rules. The bot can converse casually, offer knowledge on various subjects, and even crack jokes. For anyone interested in understanding the fundamentals of chatbot creation, it's an excellent place to start.


**Features**
1. predetermined Responses: The bot uses a dictionary of predetermined response rules to determine how to respond to user input.
2. Randomized Responses: To add some spice to the dialogue, the bot can select at random from a list of potential answers for each input.
3. Fallback Response: The bot will ask the user to restate their query as a fallback response if it is unable to understand what they have entered.
4. Simple and extensible: The code is written in a way that makes it simple to add additional functionalities and response rules.


**How It Works**
1. User Input: A message is typed by the user.
2. Processing of Input: The bot lowers the input and looks for keywords in the response rules that have already been established.
3. Generate Response: The bot chooses a random response at random from the related list if a keyword is found. A default response is returned if no keyword matches.
4. Output: The response is printed by the bot.
